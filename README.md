# Food-Wastage-Management-system

### Description : Did you know that about 40 % of the food produced in India is wasted? Despite adequate food production, the UN has reported that about 190 million Indians remain undernourished. It is further estimated that the value of food wastage in India is around ₹92,000 crores per annum


Food waste management in India is becoming a critical problem due to the continuous increase of the Indian population. Indians waste the maximum amount of food as much as the whole of the UK consumes – a data point which will not be most indicative of our love of surfeit, because it is of our population. Most of the food is wasted in weddings, canteens, hotels, social and family functions, and households.
